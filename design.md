# Design for Movies Page

It renders a layout component called `MoviesLayout` and displays information about "The Lord of the Rings." The page includes a title, a description, a grid component to display movie data, and links to other pages.

## Page Structure

The page is structured as follows:

1. **Page Title**: The page displays a title "The Lord of the Rings" at the top, rendered as an `h1` element with the class `text-2xl text-center`.

2. **Page Description**: A paragraph element (`p`) is used to provide a brief description of "The Lord of the Rings" books and movie adaptations.

3. **All Movies Title**: Another title "All Movies" is displayed, rendered as an `h2` element with the class `text-2xl text-center`.

4. **Grid**: The `Grid` component is used to display movie data. It receives the `data` fetched from the `getMovies` function as a prop.

5. **Links to Pages**: Two links are provided to navigate to other pages. Both links are wrapped in `Link` components from the `next/link` package. The first link points to the "/characters" page, and the second link points to the "/quotes" page. Both links have the class `duration-300 hover:underline` for styling.

## Dependencies

The code relies on the following imports:

- `getMovies` from the "@/lib/api" module: This function is used to fetch movie data.
- `MoviesLayout` from the "./layout" module: This layout component wraps the content of the Movies page.
- `Grid` from the "./components/movies/grid" module: This component is responsible for rendering the movie grid.
- `Link` from the "next/link" package: This component is used to create links to other pages.

## Asynchronous Function

The `Movies` component is declared as an asynchronous function. It awaits the result of the `getMovies` function before rendering the page's content. This ensures that the data is available before the page is displayed.

## Additional Notes

- The component uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling, such as `mt-8`, `mb-16`, `text-center`, `gap-[30px]`, etc.
- The `Grid` component is expected to receive the fetched movie data as a prop, which is stored in the `data` variable.

This is the basic design and structure of the Movies page based on the provided code snippet. Further details about the layout, styling, and functionality can be added as needed.
